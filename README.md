Algorithm Visualizer

Description:
An interactive web application that visualizes core sorting, searching, and binary tree traversal algorithms. Users can input custom arrays, control animation speed, pause/resume execution, and view runtime in milliseconds. Designed to make algorithm concepts intuitive and engaging.

Features:

Sorting: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge â€“ step-by-step visualization with pause/resume, speed control, and runtime display.

Searching: Linear and Binary Search with element highlighting and runtime display.

Trees: Binary Search Tree insertion, Inorder/Preorder/Postorder traversals with step highlighting and runtime.

UI: Tabbed interface, clean design, interactive and educational.

Technologies:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVG

Learning Outcome:
Demonstrates understanding of data structures, algorithms, asynchronous visualization, and interactive UI development.
